    "This follow-along reading is organized to match the content in the video that follows. It contains the same code shown in the next video. These code blocks will provide you with the opportunity to see how the code is written, allow you to practice running it, and can be used as a reference to refer back to.\n",

    "Here the code creates a list of dictionaries with the data that we want to store. For this example, we want to store data about the users in our company and the departments that they work in. So here we have our list of dictionaries and each contain the keys, name, username and department. We now want to write this HTML file. So we first define the list of keys that we want to write to the file, then we open the file for writing. Next we created the DictWriter passing the keys that we had identified before, and then we call two different methods on the writer. The right header method will create the first line of the CSV based on keys that we passed, and the right rows method will turn the list of dictionaries into lines in that file."
