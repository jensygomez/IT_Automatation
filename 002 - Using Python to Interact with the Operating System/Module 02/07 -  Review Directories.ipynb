    "\n",
    "Here is the code all together. This code defines a dir variable with the name of the directory that we want to check. This makes our code more readable and more usable. Then, it iterates through the file names returned by the os.listdir. We know from our previous execution of this function that these are just the names of the files without directory. So using os.path.join, we join the directory to each of those file names and create a String with a valid full name. Finally, we use that full name to call os.path.isdir to check if it's a directory or a file."
