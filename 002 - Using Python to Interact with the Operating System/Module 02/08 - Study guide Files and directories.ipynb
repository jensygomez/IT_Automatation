    "Managing files and directories includes creating, deleting, and moving files and directories. It also includes changing ownership and permissions of the files and directories. There are several ways to manage files and directories in Python. One of the easiest ways is to use low-level functions in the OS and SYS modules that closely mimic standard Linux commands such as **os.mkdir()** and **os.rmdir()**. Alternatively, you can utilize the Pathlib module, which provides an object-oriented interface to working with the file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at two examples. The first example uses OS; the second uses Pathlib. These two code examples do the same thing: They create a directory called **test1** and move a file named **README.md** from the sample_data folder into **test1.**\n",

    "## The OS module\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s OS module, or the miscellaneous operating system interface, is very useful for file operations, directories, and permissions. Let’s take a look at each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File operations\n",
    "\n",
    "File names can be thought of as two names separated by a dot. For example, _helloworld.txt_ is the file name and the extension defines the file type. OS provides functions to create, read, update, and delete files. Some of the basic functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Opening and closing files\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Reading from and writing to files\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Appending to files\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "OS also provides functions to create, read, update, and delete directories, as well as change directories and list files. Knowing how to use these functions is key to working with files. For example, os.listdir( path ) returns a list of all files and subdirectories in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the ability to update file permissions is an important aspect of making installations from a terminal window. The os.chmod() provides the ability to create, read, and update permissions for individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to keep in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be aware of is that Python treats text and binary files differently. Because Python is cross-platform, it tries to automatically handle different ASCII line endings. If you’re processing a binary file, make sure to open it in binary mode so Python doesn’t try to “fix” newlines in a binary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A best practice is to always close() a file when you’re done reading or writing to it. Even though Python usually closes them for you, it’s a good signal to other people reading your code that you’re done with that file. Make sure to catch any potential errors from filesystem calls, such as permission denied, file not found, and so on. Generally, you wrap them in try/except to handle those errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to manage files and directories in Python. One way is to use low-level functions in the OS and SYS modules that closely mimic standard Linux commands. Another way is to utilize the Pathlib module, which provides an object-oriented interface to working with the file systems.\n",
