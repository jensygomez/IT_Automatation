    "# Personal Branding\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good resume and an excellent elevator pitch are important. They will show employers your skills and your work history, and they will give you a chance to impress employers with what you have done, and what you can do for them. There is one more step you can take to make sure you stand out from other candidates. Having your own personal brand will make you unique and help you stand out from other candidates. This reading will help you build your own personal brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building your personal brand\n",
    "\n",
    "Your personal brand represents you, so the first part of personal branding is to look at yourself and see what makes you unique. Brands represent what they are. Product makers use branding to help people notice their products, and to develop people’s trust in their products and keep people coming back to them. You need to build a brand that does the same things for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking an inventory of yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking an inventory of your skills, interests, and things that motivate you will give you a start in building your personal brand. You can build an inventory in any order that works best for you. Here are some examples of inventory questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What drives you to pursue the career you chose?\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Which of your talents and skills mean the most to you?\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   What is something you did in the past you are very proud of doing?\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   What kinds of tasks or projects give you the most energy?\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Think about people you admire. What do you admire about them?\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "These are examples, but you can use them to make your own inventory questions as well. Write the questions and the answers and keep them in a notebook or journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get to know your audience\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your personal inventory, get to know your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Study your potential employers and learn all about their organizations. Look for their values and goals and see how you can align your goals and values with theirs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Identify who their influencers are. Once you know about the companies offering positions, study their needs based on what the job offers say.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Identify who the stakeholders are who have the most interest in your services.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Look at your inventory and match what you know about yourself to those companies’ needs. Your talents, your skills, the things that give you energy, your strengths, your knowledge and experience, and the rest of the information you put together in your inventory are all part of the recipe for your personal brand. Now that you have the information you need, you can start putting together your brand.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify some challenges the companies are facing\n",
    "\n",
    "Branding helps consumers distinguish one service from other similar services. You can expand this branding concept to you and the services you offer as a Python automation specialist.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Identify some ongoing challenges companies face dealing with IT automation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Think about solutions to those challenges, and how you can offer unique solutions to those challenges.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Show potential employers how having you in their organizations will benefit them with your unique IT automation problem solving skills and knowledge of Python coding, cloud computing, and Linux environments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Building your brand\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have taken a personal inventory, studied your audience, and identified some challenges your audience of potential employers face in their organizations, you are ready to build your personal brand. Using the information you put together, write one or two sentences that describe you and what you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to write a few drafts before you find one you like best. Once you find the one you think is the best, you now have a brand you can use along with resumes, elevator pitches and cover letters to stand out from other candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good resume and a great elevator pitch will help you impress potential employers, but having a personal brand will help you stand out from all the other candidates. It will give potential employers something to remember you out of all the applicants they are looking at for the position."
