    "# Get Started with LinkedIn\n",
    "\n",
    "LinkedIn is a global professional network that lets you keep a resume online and link up with recruiters looking for professionals in many fields including Python automation specialists. Joining LinkedIn is easy, and there are many opportunities available through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signing up\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have a LinkedIn account yet, follow these simple steps to create one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Browse to [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Click **Join now**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  After you click **Join now**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Enter your email address and a password and click **Agree & Join** (or click **Join with Google** to link to a Google account).\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  Enter your first and last name and click **Continue**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.  Enter your country/region, your postal code, and location with the area (this helps LinkedIn find job opportunities near you).\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.  Enter your most recent job title, or select **I’m a student**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.  If you entered your most recent job title, select your employment type and enter the name of your most recent company.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9.  If you select self-employed or freelance, LinkedIn will ask for your industry.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10.  Click **confirm your email address**. You will receive an email from LinkedIn.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11.  To confirm your email address, click **Agree & Confirm** in your email.\n",
    "    \n",
    "12.  LinkedIn will then ask if you are looking for a job. Click the answer that applies. If you select **Yes**, LinkedIn will help you start looking for job opportunities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "13.  Follow any of the steps under **Join Now** that are relevant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "To **upload your resume**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  After you join LinkedIn, click on **job application settings**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Click **upload** under the **resume** section.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  LinkedIn will store four resumes so you can reuse them as you need them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "LinkedIn also has a **resume builder** that you can use to help build your resume if you are using LinkedIn on a desktop. The **resume builder** only works on a desktop or laptop computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Including basic information in your profile\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to take your time filling out every section of your profile. This helps recruiters find your profile and helps people you connect with get to know you better. Start with your photo. Here are some tips to help you choose a great picture for your new profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Choose an image that looks like you: You want to make sure that your profile is the best representation of you and that includes your photo. You want a potential connection or potential employer to be able to recognize you from your profile picture if you were to meet.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Use your industry as an example: If you are having trouble deciding what is appropriate for your profile image, look at other profiles in the same industry or from companies you are interested in to get a better sense of what you should be doing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Choose a high-resolution image: The better the resolution, the better impression it makes, so make sure the image you choose isn’t blurry. The ideal image size for a LinkedIn profile picture is 400 x 400 pixels. Use a photo where your face takes up at least 60% of the space in the frame.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Remember to smile: Your profile picture is a snapshot of who you are as a person so it is ok to be serious in your photo. But smiling helps put potential connections and potential employers at ease.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Connections are a great way to keep up to date with your previous coworkers, colleagues, classmates, or even companies you want to work with. The world is a big place with a lot of people. So here are some tips to help get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Connect to people you know personally.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Add a personal touch to your invitation message. Instead of just letting them know you would like to connect, let them know why.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  Make sure your profile picture is current so people can recognize you.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Add value. Provide them with a resource, a website link, or even some content they might find interesting in your invitation to connect.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Looking for a new position**\n",
    "\n",
    "On LinkedIn, letting recruiters and potential employers know that you are in the market for a new job is simple. Just follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Click the **Me** icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Click **View profile**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  Click the **Add profile** section drop-down and under Intro, select **Looking for a new job**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to select the appropriate filters for the new positions you might be looking for and update your profile to better fit the role that you are applying for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example [Python Automation Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3279394181&geoId=103644278&keywords=python%20automation%20engineer&location=United%20States&refresh=true) job search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows jobs available in the United States, but there are job opportunities available all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Keeping your profile up to date**\n",
    "\n",
    "Add to your profile to keep it complete, current, and interesting. For example, remember to add your Google Professional Certificate to your profile after you complete the program!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "LinkedIn is a resource that lets you keep a profile online including a resume so recruiters will always have access to anything you make public. You can use LinkedIn to look for positions and send resumes directly to the recruiters for the positions through the LinkedIn network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LinkedIn, you can find connections, search through thousands of positions offered, and learn about companies you want to work for in your career."
