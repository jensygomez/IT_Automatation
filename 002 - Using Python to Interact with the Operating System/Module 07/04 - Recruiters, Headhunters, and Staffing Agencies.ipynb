    "# Recruiters, Headhunters, and Staffing Agencies\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many ways to apply and secure jobs in the IT industry is through recruiters, headhunters, and staffing agencies. Sometimes it’s possible to secure a long-term position for a company by first completing temporary or contract work through a recruitment agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recruiters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of recruiters: external and internal. External recruiters work outside the organization they represent, usually through a recruitment agency. These types of recruiters can help candidates find a multitude of open positions in the industry and work with them on a non-contractual basis until the candidate secures a position. Internal recruiters work with the company of interest. Internal recruiters can help leverage a candidate’s application by assisting them through the hiring process within a specific company.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Staffing Agencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Staffing agencies assist companies with finding qualified candidates to fulfill their open positions. These positions range anywhere from permanent, to contract, and contract-to-hire. The staffing agencies are responsible for recruiting and sometimes conducting entry-level screening questions on candidates to ensure they are a good fit for the company. If the agency can’t find a suitable fit for the job right away, they may post the job on online job boards on behalf of the company. The company ultimately makes the final decision for who is selected, and the staffing agency assists with the initial onboarding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Career Coaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Career coaches can greatly assist with helping job seekers hone in their job search and find positions that cater to their strengths and personal values. They can also assist with guiding the candidate through all the ups and downs of the job hunting process, reframing thoughts, challenging limiting beliefs about the job search process, and finding opportunities for professional growth. However, career coaches often cost more than other routes for securing a job. Consider hiring a career coach if you’re experiencing challenges in moving up in your career, securing interviews, receiving offers, or are unsure about what the next steps in your career should look like. There are multiple types of career coaches out there. Conduct research and find the type of coach you’re looking for. Some provide basic services such as resume reviews, editing of cover letters, or LinkedIn profile analysis. Other career coaches will go further and offer live coaching sessions either in person or online, offer additional resources to help you on your journey, and/or a supportive community of other job seekers."
