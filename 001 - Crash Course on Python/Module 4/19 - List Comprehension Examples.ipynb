    "List comprehensions can be really powerful, but they can also be complex, resulting in code that’s hard to read. Be careful when using them, because they might make it more difficult for someone else looking at your code to easily understand what the code is doing. It is a best practice to add descriptive comments about any list comprehensions used in your code. This helps to communicate the purpose of list comprehensions to other coders. Comments will also help you remember the goal of the code when performing future code additions and maintenance.\n",
