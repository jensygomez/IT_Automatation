    "# Use while loops and if else statements for dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve learned that if statements are used as a form of decision making. If statements tell your computer to perform a conditional execution based on the value of an expression. Using else in conjunction with an if statement allows your computer to evaluate for multiple conditions and run a statement if other conditions are false. In other words, else is the condition that runs if all other statements are not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve also learned that while loops instruct your computer to continuously execute your code based on the value of a condition, but it will only continue to execute as long as the evaluation statement is True. Once that statement is no longer True, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn about using while loops and if else statements for dictionaries, and see examples demonstrating the benefits of using them in your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## while  **loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are used to organize elements into collections using pairs of keys and values. But what do you do when you need to search a collection of data for a value? That’s where while loops come in. A while loop will iterate through conditions until one comes up False, unlike a for loop, which will iterate through the entire dictionary, one row at a time. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for item in someDictionary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <code goes here>\n",
    "\n",
    "versus:\n",
    "\n",
    "    while someDictionary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <code goes here>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the difference between the for loop and the while loop—unlike the for loop, the while loop does not require calling a variable to act as a counter, or the “item” variable in the for loop. for loops anticipate a specific structure—like a list—and when called, will iterate through the entire list, until it gets to the end. while loops can be used more universally when the structure of your data set is more ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## if else  **statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "if else statements are useful if you want to find and check for specific values and perform specific actions based on the result. Consider the following example:\n"

    "The goal here is to search if the key “banana” exists in the dictionary. The first line determines the key, “banana,” which is what we want to search for in the dictionary. The second line uses an if statement to search for the key within the dictionary and prints the value of that particular key **if** the condition is True. The else statement will return that the key was not found in the dictionary if the condition is False. As an example, this code block will return “The value of banana is 3” or “banana is not found in the dictionary” when it is run.\n",

    "while loops and if else statements are methods you can use to search for values within a dictionary. If you want to search through an entire dictionary quickly to find a value, use a while loop. If you want to search through a dictionary to find and check a value, use an if else statement to return the value and perform specific actions based on the result.\n"
