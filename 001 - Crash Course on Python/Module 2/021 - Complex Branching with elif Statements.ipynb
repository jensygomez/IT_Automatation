    "# Complex Branching with elif Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Building off of the _if_ and _else_ blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement, the _elif_ statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching. Very similar to the _if_ statements, an _elif_ statement starts with the _elif_ keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated. This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right. An _elif_ statement must follow an _if_ statement, and will only be evaluated if the _if_ statement was evaluated as false. You can include multiple _elif_ statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!"
