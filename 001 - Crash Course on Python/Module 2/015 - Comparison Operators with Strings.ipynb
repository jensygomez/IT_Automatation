    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn more about what comparison operators can and cannot do. If you use the **==** (equality) and **!=** (not equal to)  operators with strings, you can check if two strings contain the same text or not. You can also alphabetize strings using **>** (greater than), **<** (less than)**, >=** (greater than or equal to)**, <=** (less than or equal to) comparison operators. As with numeric data types, comparison operators used with strings will return Boolean (**True**, **False**) results.\n",

    "# PART 1: Equality **==** and Not Equal to **!=** Operators with Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare strings. The equality **==** and the not equal to **!=** operators are helpful when you need to search for a specific string in a body of text, a log file, a spreadsheet, a database, and more. You can also check user input strings to compare them to another string. Note that Boolean data types are not string data types (Boolean **True** is not equal to the string \"True\").\n",
