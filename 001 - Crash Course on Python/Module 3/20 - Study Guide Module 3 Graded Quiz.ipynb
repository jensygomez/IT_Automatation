    "# Study Guide: Module 3 Graded Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to prepare for the Module 3 Graded Quiz. Please review the following items from this module before beginning the Module 3 Graded Quiz. If you would like to refresh your memory on these materials, please also revisit the [**while** Loop Study Guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/supplement/iyNWi/study-guide-while-loops) and the [**for** Loop Study Guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/supplement/dqH6E/study-guide-for-loops) located before the Practice Quizzes in Module 3. You will not be tested on the Recursion lesson content, which is optional in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **variables** - Know how to properly initialize or increment a variable. You will also need to recognize a coding error due to the failure to properly initialize or increment a variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **infinite loops** - Know how to recognize infinite loops and use common solutions to prevent them. For example, check loop conditions, ranges, iterators, control statements, etc. to ensure that at least one of these controls are in place to prevent an infinite loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **iterators** - Know the various options available for iterating a variable (e.g., using assignment operators, using the third **range()** function parameter). You will also need to analyze where the iteration should occur. A misplaced iterator could produce the wrong output or create an infinite loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **control statements** - Know how and when to use the **break** and **continue** control statements to prevent infinite loops.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **range() Function Parameters** - Know the roles of the three possible **range(x, y, z)** function parameters:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   **x** Start of Range (included)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    -   **y** End of Range (excluded index)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        -   To include the end of range index, use the expression **y+1**\n",
    "            \n",
    "        -   The end of range must be included in the **range()** parameters.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    -   **z** Incremental value\n",
    "        \n",
    "    -   **Example 1:** range(4, 12**+1**, **2**)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        -   This example creates a range that starts at 4 and ends at 12 (without the **+1**, the range would end at 11).\n",
    "            \n",
    "        -   The third parameter increments the range iteration by 2, as opposed to the default increment of 1. The **range(4, 12+1, 2)** expression would produce the values: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n",
    "            \n",
    "    -   **Example 2:** range(10, 2**-1**, **-2**)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        -   This example creates a range that starts at 10 and ends at 2**-1**, with a decremental value of **-2**. When counting down, to include the value of the end of the range index, use **-1** (end of range minus 1). This range produces the sequence: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2\n",
    "            \n",
    "\n",
    "-   **print() Function Default Behavior** - Know the default behavior of the **print()** function is to insert a new line character after the print statement runs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   To override the insertion of the new line character and replace it with a space, add **end=\" \"** as the last item in the **print()** parameters. This makes it possible to add the next print output to the same line, separated by a space. You might use this technique when a print() function is part of a **for** or **while** loop. Example syntax: **print(x+1, end=\" \")**\n",

    "\n",
    "Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now.\n",

    "No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately, you have 3 optional retake opportunities on the graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimited retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course.\n",
