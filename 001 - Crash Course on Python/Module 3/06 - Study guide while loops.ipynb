    "## **Common errors in Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error message on a loop or it appears to hang, your debugging checklist should include the following checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Failure to initialize variables**. Make sure all the variables used in the loop’s condition are initialized before the loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Unintended infinite loops**. Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables. You can often prevent an infinite loop by using the break keyword or by adding end criteria to the condition part of the while loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Terms**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **while loop** - Tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is True. In other words, while loops keep executing the same group of instructions until the condition becomes False.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **infinite loop** - Missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **break** - A break statement in Python provides a way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false. Once a break statement is encountered, the program's control flow jumps out of the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.\n",
    "    \n",

    "The coding problems on the upcoming practice quiz will involve a few math concepts. Don’t worry if you are rusty on math. You will have plenty of support with these concepts on the quiz. The following is a quick overview of the math terms you will encounter on the quiz:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **prime numbers** - Integers that have only two factors, which are the number itself multiplied by 1. The first ten prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. Each of these prime numbers can be evenly divided only by itself and 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **prime factors** - Prime numbers that are factors of an integer. For example, the prime numbers 2 and 5 are the prime factors of the number 10 (2x5=10). The prime factors of an integer will not produce a remainder when used to divide that integer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **divisor** - A number (denominator) that is used to divide another number (numerator). For example, if the number 10 is divided by 5, the number 5 is the divisor.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **sum of all divisors of a number** - The result of adding all of the divisors of a number together.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **multiplication table** - An integer multiplied by a series of numbers and their results formatted as a table or a list. For example:\n",
