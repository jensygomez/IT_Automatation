    "# Creating a Career Development Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several components and aspects of your potential career to consider while you are job searching. Before embarking on your journey, it is important to outline your career path. Doing so will help you find opportunities that align with your values, interests, and aspirations. As a Python automation developer, you have a myriad of options available to you. Many industries are hiring IT professionals to assist with Python development, debugging code, troubleshooting issues, recommending solutions, and automating processes on cloud platforms and in Linux environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying career goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do you want to accomplish as a Python automation professional?** There are multiple specialist fields in the IT industry that will give you the opportunity to further develop and hone your skills in automating with Python. However, you can just as easily take the generalist route and cross-apply your knowledge of Python, cloud computing, and Linux to various roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do you aspire to eventually work in management in any capacity?** If so, it’s important during your job hunt to ask about opportunities for advancement or transition throughout the company. Some companies are limited in opportunities due to long-term employee retention or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are your unique strengths and skills that you bring with you to a company?** Identifying your strengths, both soft and hard skills, will help you stand out from other applicants. There are a plethora of transferable skills that you can use to leverage your application. If you’re not sure where to start on identifying your unique strengths and identifying your transferable skills, there are lots of online resources and platforms to help you get an idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skill stacking is becoming more appealing to hiring managers and companies within the field of technology. Skill stacking is when employees combine skills from different fields or industries to produce novel ideas, approaches, and systems. Soft skills are the most important skills to have if you’re considering any position in management or if you want to work in a team-based work environment. Having the skills to hold conversations, navigate conflict, and collaborate with others will highly benefit your career.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question that is asked in interviews is, “where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?” Creating a timeline for you and your career is helpful in gaining insight into what career opportunities will work best for you moving forward. One helpful way to gain clarity into this is to break down your bigger career goals into smaller goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach your job search and career in IT with an open mind. Be flexible with deadlines, milestones, and your own personal timeline. Be receptive to potential job opportunities that you might not traditionally apply to or pursue. Adaptability and flexibility are two of the most coveted soft skills employers look for in their employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, hold yourself accountable for your own progress. Technology is always changing and staying informed of all the changes that pertain to your job or specialty will give you an advantage over other employees. Look at taking other certifications, take online courses, read books on the subject, attend conferences, continuously network with other professionals in your field, and/or complete passion projects in your free time. Taking extra measures to inform yourself about your field and attending events with other professionals will greatly increase your chances of success and career satisfaction."
