    "# Getting Promoted\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already have a technical job and are building your skills to advance your career. You may be considering asking for a promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that you have the Python and automation tools to successfully advance your career. Now is the time to plan for what to do next, with special consideration as to which career path to pursue. Perhaps you're interested in using your Python skills for analyzing data or developing software. You might be considering using your automation knowledge to streamline the maintenance of a Linux network or cloud environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the growth opportunities in your organization? Do they support training? Is this a transitional job? Is this your dream job? All these questions must be taken into account when planning your next steps. After you answer those basic questions, you have to prepare and space your next steps accordingly. If you are planning to grow within your organization, there are a few considerations that you should evaluate to get to the place where you want to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to consider when planning for a promotion is performing beyond average at your current position. This means proving to your employer that you are not only capable of doing your actual job, but that you are capable of taking on bigger responsibilities. How do you achieve that?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Work on your development.** You should always do your best to excel in your job. You can stand out from the crowd by adding value to your contributions to the company. How are you improving efficiency, saving money, bringing in new revenue? To get a chance at that promotion, you need to be the employee that gives more every day, willing to take new responsibilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Show leadership and be a team player.** Showing that you are a team player and can take leadership roles will help you to get noticed by your employer. Strive to be a role model, gain your coworkers respect, and motivate your team members. In other words, display and build qualities that will make you a good leader.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Continue your education.** When developing your career path, consider and plan for future certifications and training. For example, if you are planning to get from Python coder to Data Analyst, plan to earn a new certificate, like the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Check for your company’s Data Analyst job requirements and improve your skills accordingly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Maintain strong work ethics.** Always be punctual for work, have excellent customer service, meet your deadlines, excel at your job, be respectful, and collaborate with your coworkers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Communicate with your boss, your coworkers, and your customers.** Good communication is a key characteristic to display in any type of job, but when you are looking for a promotion, you need to excel in the way you communicate. It is crucial to know how to communicate. It will help when planning for your career path and add some communication training to your skill development.\n",

    "Planning for a promotion doesn't necessarily mean that you are going to get one. Sometimes you will need to ask for it, or change roles or organization in order to achieve it. However, to be ready and able to demonstrate your value as part of an organization, remember to:\n",
