# Welcome to the Course!

## **Welcome to the course!**

This course is designed to teach you the foundations of programming in Python. We’re excited to join you on this journey as you learn one of the most-in-demand job skills in IT today. In the U.S. alone, according to Indeed data from November 2023, there were ~818K job openings in 2023 asking for Python skills.

### **Course prerequisites**

This course requires no previous knowledge of programming. Familiarity with basic IT concepts, like operating systems, files and processes, networking and data management will be required in further courses. For learners with no IT background at all, we recommend taking the [IT Support Professional Certificate 101](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-it-support).

### **How to pass the class**

You can review videos, readings, discussion forums, in-video questions, and practice quizzes in the program for free. However, to access graded assignments and be eligible to receive your official Google IT Support certificate, you must:

- Pay the [course certificate fee](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818963-Payments-on-Coursera?language=en_US), or apply and be approved for [Coursera Financial Aid](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US).

AND

- Pass all graded assignments in the six courses at the minimum passing level, or above. Each graded assignment in a course is part of a cumulative grade for that course. The passing score for each course is 80%. 

### **How deadlines work**

When you enroll in the course, the system automatically sets a deadline for when you need to complete each section. Heads up: These deadlines are there to help you organize your time, but you can take the course at your own pace. If you "miss" a deadline, you can just reset it to a new date. There’s no time limit in which you have to finish the course, and you can earn the certificate whenever you finish.

### **Getting and giving help**

Here are a few ways you can give and get help: 

1. Discussion forums: You can share information and ideas with your fellow learners in the discussion forums. These are also great places to find answers to questions you may have. If you're stuck on a concept, are struggling to solve a practice exercise, or you just want more information on a subject, the discussion forums are there to help you move forward.

2. Coursera learner support: Use the [Learner Help Center](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us) to find information on specific technical issues. These include error messages, difficulty submitting assignments, or problems with video playback. If you can’t find an answer in the documentation, you can also report your problem to the Coursera support team by clicking on the Contact Us! link available at the bottom of help center articles.

3. Course content issues: You can also flag problems in course materials by rating them. When you rate course materials, the instructor will see your ratings and feedback; other learners won’t. To rate course materials:
- Open the course material you want to rate. You can only rate videos, readings, and quizzes.

- If the item was interesting or helped you learn, click the thumbs-up icon.

- If the item was unhelpful or confusing, click the thumbs-down icon.

### **Finding out more information**

Throughout this course, we'll be teaching you the basics of programming and automation. We'll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings. But sometimes, you may also need to look things up on your own, now and throughout your career. Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research so you stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find additional information— it’s great practice for the real world!

On top of search results, here are some good programming resources available online:

- The official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). This tutorial is designed to help people teach themselves Python. While it goes in a different order than the one we're taking here, it covers a lot of the same subjects that we explore in this course. You can refer to this resource for extra information on these subjects.

- The [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) book. This book aims to teach people how to program in Python. It's available online in PDF and browsable forms. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about some of the subjects we cover.

The [official language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). This is a technical reference of all Python language components. At first, this resource might be a little too complex, but as you learn how Python works and how it’s built, this can be a useful reference to understand the details of these interactions.

**Note:** As you progress this course you may see updated or repeated content due to Google’s regular review of the certificate program to provide the most up-to-date skills and tools in the industry. These changes include the addition of new practice material and supportive content. In addition, Google’s certificate updates sometimes include changes to graded items like quizzes and labs. If you have previously completed a graded item in this course, you *may*  need to take a new assessment to complete this course. We hope the new content will support you on your learning journey!
