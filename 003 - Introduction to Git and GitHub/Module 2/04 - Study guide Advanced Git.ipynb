    "\n",
    "[$ git commit -a](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---all) automatically stages the files that have been locally modified. New files which have not been published yet are not affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "git log -p\n",
    "\n",
    "[$ git log -p](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#generate_patch_text_with_p) produces patch text that displays the lines of code that were changed in each commit in the current repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "git show\n",

    "[$ git show](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-show) shows you one or more object(s) such as blobs, trees, tags, and commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "git diff\n",
    "\n",
    "[$ git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) is similar to the Linux `diff` command, and can show the changes between commits, changes between the working tree and index, changes between two trees, changes from a merge, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "git diff --staged\n",
    "\n",
    "[$ git diff --staged](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) is an alias of $ git diff --cached, which shows all staged files compared to the named commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "git add -p\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "[$ git rm](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm) is similar to the Linux `rm` command. This command deletes or removes a file from the working tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many useful git command summaries online as well. Please take some time to research and study a few, such as [this one](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## .gitignore files\n",
    "\n",
    ".gitignore files are used to tell the git tool to intentionally ignore some files in a given Git repository. For example, this can be useful for configuration files or metadata files that a user may not want to check into the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a .gitignore file, there are some specific formats which help tell Git how to read the text in the file. For example, a line starting with # is a comment; a slash / is a directory separator. Visit [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to see more examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This GitHub repository](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657) offers some examples of configurations which are often included in a .gitignore file. These examples include: compiled sources, packages, logs, databases, and OS generated files."
